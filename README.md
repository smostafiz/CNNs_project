# Face and Eye Detection and Anonymization Project
This project focuses on developing algorithms to detect and anonymize human faces in images using cascade classifiers. The process involves:
Face Detection: Utilizing cascade classifiers to detect faces in grey-scaled images.
Eye Detection and Blurring: Applying eye classifiers to detect and blur eyes in the detected faces.
Anonymization Techniques: Implementing methods like image resizing and feature blurring to ensure privacy.
The project addresses challenges in detection accuracy and presents solutions to enhance performance. The dataset includes three distinct images: an indoor photo of a full-body human subject, an outdoor photo with multiple distant individuals, and a photo of a non-human subject.
